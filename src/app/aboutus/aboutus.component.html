<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Qualified Teachers:</h2>
<p>Teacher qualifications have a direct positive correlation with student achievement. Measures of teacher preparation and certification are by far the strongest predictors of student achievement in any field. Students simply perform better if their teachers are knowledgeable. At Nihareeka, we have established a mantra that our teachers need to be highly qualified in their field of study. We believe that the teaching professionals must raise the overall level of their teaching in order to promote the greatest student achievement. The change from semi-professional to true professional stature of a teacher is what must happen for students to fully benefit from their education. Just as doctors, lawyers, accountants and even soldiers must continue their education in order to keep abreast of the latest and greatest ways to do their jobs effectively and proficiently,
     so must teachers in this new era of teaching. Our faculty of teachers not only know the content of what they are teaching, but also represent an understanding of the subject matter far beyond what will be covered in the classroom. </p>
